<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Reepak Kumar Rout, a student and aspiring full-stack web developer based in Odisha, India. I'm currently learning 
  the core technologies of web development including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL, and actively working on sharpening my skills 
  through personal practice and creative exploration.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a quick learner with a strong sense of disciplineâ€”something I carry from my structured daily routine, which includes early 
  morning workouts and a lean bulking diet to build muscle. My focus, consistency, and drive donâ€™t just apply to fitnessâ€”they
   fuel my passion for tech and growth as a developer.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a sports enthusiastâ€”I love playing badminton and am proud to be a national bronze medalist in karate.
   I also enjoy gaming and painting, which help me stay creative and balanced.</p>

<p>I speak Odia, Hindi, and English, and Iâ€™m always eager to collaborate and connect with others in the tech space. <br />
